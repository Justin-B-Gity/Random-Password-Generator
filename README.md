If you are reading this, you want to use my program.

Have you ever had the trouble of making a password for a website, and you cant think of a good password to use? Well, worry no longer, because that is what this project is for!
Using a combination of different characters, numbers, and symbols, the Random-Password-Generator (nicknamed the RPG) can create all the passwords you may ever need in your life. 
This project uses a Graphical User Interface to guide the user into creating the password that they desire to use. 
When in use, click the different checkmarks to select if you want uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, depending on the website you are making a password for. 
You can also type in the desired length of the password that you want. Once finished, you can click the "New Password" button on the bottom left, and in a second, your password is completed!
I also added two buttons where you can add the newly created password to a file called "Saved_Passwords.txt" and can copy the password to your clipboard so you can make a new account right away. 

I plan to add some new features in the future. Anything that you may think I should add to improve the experience, please let me know!

Thanks for using, use responsively,
Justin-B-Gity
